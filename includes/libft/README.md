# libft
This is the first project that must be completed at 42, a library of functions that are mostly re-creations of standard library functions plus some extras for manipulating linked-lists. And a few I made up because they seemed useful.

It took me roughly a month to pass all of the tests from moulinette (moulinette is a robot that rigourously tests our code before peer evaluation).

It was very important to do well on this project since these functions are to be used in place of any standard library functions I end up needing for future projects.

## usage
To compile the static library:
1. Clone or download this repository
2. cd into the folder
3. run make re
4. link to libft.a in your project

Enjoy!
